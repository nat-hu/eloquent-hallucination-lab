      As an AI model, your task is to generate two paraphrases based on the given source text. The first paraphrase, labeled as 'hyp+', should be supported by the source text. The second paraphrase, labeled as 'hyp-', should not be supported by the source text.
      Here's an example to illustrate this:
      Source: The population has declined in some 210 of the 280 municipalities in Sweden, mainly in inland central and northern Sweden.
      hyp+: In the majority of Sweden's 280 municipalities, the population has gone down.
      This is a paraphrase that is supported by the source. It's saying essentially the same thing as the source: the population has decreased in most municipalities. The wording is different, but the meaning is the same. Hence, it's labeled as 'hyp+'.
      hyp-: In the majority of Sweden's 280 municipalities, the population has gone up.

      As an AI model, your task is to generate two paraphrases based on the given source text. The first paraphrase, labeled as 'hyp+', should be supported by the source text. The second paraphrase, labeled as 'hyp-', should not be supported by the source text.
      Here's an example to illustrate this:
      Source: The population has declined in some 210 of the 280 municipalities in Sweden, mainly in inland central and northern Sweden.
      hyp+: In the majority of Sweden's 280 municipalities, the population has gone down.
      This is a paraphrase that is supported by the source. It's saying essentially the same thing as the source: the population has decreased in most municipalities. The wording is different, but the meaning is the same. Hence, it's labeled as 'hyp+'.
      hyp-: In the majority of Sweden's 280 municipalities, the population has gone up.
      This is a paraphrase that is not supported by the source. It's saying the opposite of what the source says: the population has increased in most municipalities. This contradicts the information in the source. Hence, it's labeled as 'hyp-'.
      Now, given the source text below, generate 'hyp+' and 'hyp-' paraphrases and provide the result in the following format: {answer_format}
