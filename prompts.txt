1. Given a source labeled as "src" and two hypotheses, "hyp1" and "hyp2", determine which hypothesis is contradicted by the source.2. As an AI model, your task is to determine which of the two hypotheses, "hyp1" and "hyp2," is not supported by the given source, labeled as either "hyp1" or "hyp2."3. You are given a source and two hypotheses (Hyp1 and Hyp2). Identify the hypothesis that finds more specific support within the source.4. You are a researcher investigating a new phenomenon. You have gathered data (source) and formulated two competing hypotheses (Hyp1 and Hyp2) to explain it.  Identify the hypothesis that contradicts the information provided in the given source.5. Your task is to identify the hypothesis, either "hyp1" or "hyp2," that contradicts the information provided in the given source, labeled as "src."6. Your task is to identify the hypothesis, either "hyp1" or "hyp2," that hallucinates the information provided in the given source, labeled as "src."
