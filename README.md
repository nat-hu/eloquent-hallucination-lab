# eloquent-hallucination-lab
This project represents a comprehensive research effort for the ELOQUENT Lab at CLEF 2024, focusing on the dual challenge of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous evaluators. The core objective was to develop systems capable of both generating realistic hallucinations and detecting them within multilingual contexts.
